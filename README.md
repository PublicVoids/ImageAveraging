# ImageAveraging
Test for averging images in python vc2 to improve quality of static images using bad camera.

For me it is learning with git and github

it is about using a camera in python
-shooting static frames
-adding them to increase signal to noise
-sharpen or deblur the image.

evaluate the quality improvement.
